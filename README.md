## Specializations
1. ### Deep Learning [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Specialization/Deep%20Learning.pdf)
   1. #### Neural Networks and Deep Learning [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning.pdf)
       > In the first course of the Deep Learning Specialization, I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. 
   1. #### Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Improving%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks%20-%20Hyperparameter%20Tuning%2C%20Regularization%20and%20Optimization.pdf)
       > In the second course of the Deep Learning Specialization, I studied open the deep learning black box to understand the processes that drive performance and generate good results systematically. 
   1. #### Structuring Machine Learning Projects [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Structuring%20Machine%20Learning%20Projects.pdf)
       > In the third course of the Deep Learning Specialization, I learned how to build a successful machine learning project and get to practice decision-making as a machine learning project leader. 
   1. #### Convolutional Neural Networks [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Convolutional%20Neural%20Networks.pdf)
       > In the fourth course of the Deep Learning Specialization, I understood how computer vision has evolved and become familiar with its exciting applications such as autonomous driving, face recognition, reading radiology images, and more.
   1. #### Sequence Models [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Sequence%20Models.pdf)
       > In the fifth course of the Deep Learning Specialization, I become familiar with NLP models and their exciting applications such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language understanding, and more that have become possible with the evolution of sequence algorithms thanks to deep learning. 
2. ### Data Structures and Algorithms [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Specialization/Deep%20Learning.pdf)
    1. #### Algorithmic Toolbox [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Algorithmic%20Toolbox.pdf)
        > The course covered basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. 
    2. #### Data Structures [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Data%20Structures.pdf)
        > In this course, I learned how these data structures are implemented in different programming languages and will practice implementing them in our programming assignments.
    3. #### Algorithms on Graphs [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Algorithms%20on%20Graphs.pdf)
        > In this course, I first learned what a graph is and what are some of the most important properties. Then  learned several ways to traverse graphs and how do useful things while traversing the graph in some order.
    4. #### Algorithms on Strings [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Algorithms%20on%20Strings.pdf)
        > World and internet is full of textual information. We search for information using textual queries, we read websites, books, e-mails. All those are strings from the point of view of computer science.
    5. #### Advanced Algorithms and Complexity [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Advanced%20Algorithms%20and%20Complexity.pdf)
        > still now, I learned the basic algorithms now and are ready to step into the area of more complex problems and algorithms to solve them. Advanced algorithms build upon basic ones and use new ideas.
    6. #### Genome Assembly Programming Challenge [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Genome%20Assembly%20Programming%20Challenge.pdf)
        > In Spring 2011, thousands of people in Germany were hospitalized with a deadly disease that started as food poisoning with bloody diarrhea and often led to kidney failure.
3. ### Python for Everybody [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Specialization/Python%20for%20Everybody.pdf)
    1. #### Programming for Everybody [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Programming%20for%20Everybody%20(Getting%20Started%20with%20Python).pdf)
       > This course aims to teach everyone the basics of programming computers using Python.
    2. #### Python Data Structures [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Python%20Data%20Structures.pdf)
       > This course introduced the core data structures of the Python programming language.
    3. #### Using Python to Access Web Data [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Using%20Python%20to%20Access%20Web%20Data.pdf)
       > This course shown how one can treat the Internet as a source of data. And I have scrape, parse, and read web data as well as access data using web APIs.
    4. #### Using Databases with Python [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Using%20Databases%20with%20Python.pdf)
       > This course introduced the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) as well as basic database design for storing data as part of a multi-step data gathering, analysis, and processing effort.
    5. #### Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python [Certificate](../main/Certificates/Capstone%20-%20Retrieving%2C%20Processing%2C%20and%20Visualizing%20Data%20with%20Python.pdf)
       > In the capstone, I built a series of applications to retrieve, process and visualize data using Python.   The projects will involve all the elements of the specialization.
